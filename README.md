# easyOA

每天阅读论文，经常各种pdf链接满天飞，很头疼，根据自己的需求，编写了 easyOA 插件，它可以：
1. PDF页面重命名为论文标题，方便标签页管理和搜索；
2. 单击图标返回摘要页，摆脱手动修改URL。

Reading papers every day, I often receive various PDF links, which can be quite overwhelming. To meet my own needs, I developed the `easyOA` plugin, which can:
1. Rename PDF pages with the paper title for easier tab management and searching.
2. Return to the abstract page with a single click on the icon, eliminating the need for manually modifying the URL.


目前支持的OA网站有 / Currently supported OA websites:
- arxiv.org
- openreview.net
- aclantology.org
- openaccess.thecvf.com
- proceedings.mlr.press
- papers.nips.cc


可能开发的功能 / Possible future developments:
1. Download PDF with custom filename in the abstract page.
2. link arxiv for abstract pages on ojs.aaai.org.


## 安装 / Install

之后会上传到 Chrome 应用商店，现在可以下载或克隆到本地，以开发者模式手动安装，参见 [How to install the unpacked extension in Chrome](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) (安装时选择本项目下的 `./chrome` 文件夹).


I am currently trying to upload it to the Chrome Web Store.
For now, you can clone it to your local machine and install it in developer mode.
Refer to [How to install the unpacked extension in Chrome](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) (select the `./chrome` folder of this repo).
